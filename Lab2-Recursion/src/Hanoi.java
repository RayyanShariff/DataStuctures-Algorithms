	 * calls to {@link #moveOneRing(int,int)} with the correct tower index arguments
	 * {@from} and {@to} such that when the game is executed by {@link #playHanoi()}
	 * the game completes without violating the rules checked by
	 * {@link #checkTower(int)} and the JUnit tests in HanoiTest.java.
	 * 
	 * For example, to play with 3 rings, moving them all from tower A to tower B,
	 * the valid execution is:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * moveOneRing(0,1)
	 * moveOneRing(0,2)
	 * moveOneRing(1,2)
	 * moveOneRing(0,1)
	 * moveOneRing(2,0)
	 * moveOneRing(2,1)
	 * moveOneRing(0,1)
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * where 0 is tower A, 1 is tower B, 2 is tower C.
	 *
	 * @param n    a counter that, when n==1 means we've removed all rings above the
	 *             bottom ring
	 * @param from the index of the tower to move all rings from
	 * @param to   the index of the tower to move all rings to
	 * @param via  the index of the tower which intermediate rings will be moved to
