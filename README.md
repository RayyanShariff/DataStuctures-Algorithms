# Java Data Structures and Algorithm Labs

## Overview
This repository contains various lab assignments for learning different data structures and algorithms in Java. It is part of the F28SG Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms  course at Heriot-Watt University Each lab focuses on a specific topic and includes source code and tests.

## Lab Structure

The repository is organized into the following labs:

- **Lab1-Stacks**: Implementation and testing of stack operations.
- **Lab2-Recursion**: Exercises on recursive algorithms.
- **Lab3-LinkedList**: Implementation of linked lists.
- **Lab4-Queues-DoublyLinkedLists**: Exercises on queues and doubly linked lists.
